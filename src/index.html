                                    Andrew Aude</a>. He was using Signal on a work-issued phone. Even if he was using
                                Tor in combination, if your employer can just take screenshots of your device, no amount
                                of encryption or technology will keep you private. The lesson: never use your
                                work-issued devices for anything you want to remain private or an employer-owned network
                                to connect to a site you want to keep private.</p>

                                connections—including your DNS or internet service providers—may be able to see your IP
                                address and the address to which you're connecting. They *will not* be able to see which
                                page you're on, who you're messaging, or the contents of your message.</p>
                            <p>When thinking about blowing the whistle, always consider: What are you protecting, and
                                who are you protecting it from? Is it a message to the local newspaper about the noisy
                                neighborhood construction, an abusive business owner, or a corrupt local official? You
                                can connect using our clearnet address and have confidence you'll remain anonymous.</p>
                            <p>Or are you sharing national security secrets from within an authoritarian government that
                                censors their internet and murders journalists? This is not legal advice, but a
                                reasonable, though possibly prohibitively complex, way to ensure anonymity may be to
                                somehow acquire and use a Tor-only amnesiac operating system like Tails or Qubes with a
                                Whonix disposable VM on an uncompromised burner device where you'll encrypt your message
                                locally before ever connecting the device to the internet. When you connect to the Hush
                                Line Onion service, it should be on an uncompromised network you do not own, to which
                                you are not related, and that isn't near your residence. Oh, and don't go anywhere that
                                uses surveillance cameras or biometric identification, only use cash and don't go to an
                                ATM near where you'll buy the device, leave your primary cell phone at home, don't check
                                in to any location requiring your real name or ID, and if you have a car with a GPS in
                                it, don't drive it. Reasonable, right? This might sound like a lot, but the point is
                                that there is no one way to use Hush Line or "perfect" anonymity. You must consider your
                                own situation uniquely. No matter what tool you use to send a message, if you share
                                sensitive enough information about an individual or entity with enough time, money, and
                                power, operational security will always be critically important.</p>

                            <p>Signal is great, but it's not anonymous. For someone to send you a message, they must
                                first:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Have an active phone number.</li>
                                <li>Sign in to an app store, requiring an email address.</li>
                                <li>Download Signal.</li>
                                <li>Register their phone number. (Yes, you still have to do this, even with usernames.)
                                </li>
                                <li>Create a username.</li>
                                <li>Find your username or phone number.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>Signal is a perfect tool for talking to someone you know or with whom you have a baseline
                                level of trust. It is linked to your phone, and you need a device with a phone number to
                                start using it.</p>
                            <p>In contrast, Hush Line works with what's already on your phone or computer. All you need
                                is a web browser to send a message anonymously. The end-user submitting a message
                                doesn't need to create an account, and needs no technical proficiency or prior knowledge
                                to use the app immediately.</p>
                            <p>Hush Line aims to be the first step for whistleblowers. When they don't know what to do
                                first or next, a safe and effortless way to contact the right person should be the least
                                of their worries. Once a baseline level of trust is established, other tools like Signal
                                are more appropriate.</p>

                            <p>SecureDrop is a robust whistleblowing platform whose architecture is necessitated by very
                                specific use cases: A.) To safely manage files sent by anonymous people so that a device
                                or network isn't accidentally compromised, and B.) To provide a censorship-resistant and
                                anonymous method of sending those files. When someone submits a message, an account is
                                created for them, allowing two-way communication. To use SecureDrop:</p>
                            <p>The tip line owner must:</p>

                                <li>Do A LOT. SecureDrop is an "on-prem" solution, requiring you to store multiple
                                    servers locally, all focused on isolated tasks, using a dedicated network. Think of
                                    SecureDrop as a fixed workflow for receiving and handling potentially malicious
                                    files. You must do all of the things correctly to assume safe operation. It requires
                                    a lot of time, which means a lot of money. The installation and setup of the system,
                                    in most cases, needs to be conducted by a member of the SD team, with service
                                    contracts helping to ensure proper maintenance of the infrastructure.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The message submitter must:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Learn how to use SecureDrop.</li>
                                <li>Download Tor Browser.</li>
                                <li>Find the correct Onion address for their recipient.</li>
                                <li>Submit a message.</li>
                                <li>Save their account credentials.</li>

                            <p>We're a managed service, so you don't have to worry about maintaining physical
                                infrastructure or learning new workflows. In fact, to use Hush Line, you don't even have
                                to log back into the service after setting it up. We can deliver messages directly to
                                your email inbox, so you can set it, forget it, and never miss a beat. Users can add
                                their own public PGP key, giving them end-to-end encryption and ensuring messages cannot
                                be read by anyone but them.</p>
                            <p>Hush Line is also available on a clearnet address, or through our Onion service. Using
                                the browser already on your computer or phone, you can easily submit a message without
                                ever downloading a new app. Users who need higher levels of anonymity may optionally use
                                our Onion service, requiring them to download Tor Browser. This flexibility allows for
                                our service to be used for benign use cases or elevated threat levels.</p>
