					<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

			        <li>
			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> How anonymous is Hush Line?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>Hush Line requires no PII for tip line owners to use the service, including an email address. We scrub IP addresses and country codes from access logs and don't timestamp messages or relate account data in any way.</p>

			            	<p>While we do not log IP addresses, attackers who have the capability to observe network connections may be able to see your IP address if they are using our clearnet address.</p>

							<p>We're also proud to offer an Onion service for users with advanced privacy needs. The Onion site can be accessed using Tor Browser, making connections and activity completely anonymous.</p>

							<p>Message submitters are not required to create an account and may use the Onion service.</p>

							<p>But there are plenty of ways to deanonymize yourself... üëá</p>
			            </div>
			        </li>
			        <li>
			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png">How can I be deanonymized?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>Neither us scrubbing IPs nor you using Tor and Signal are silver bullets, and there are many ways to out yourself. <a href="https://github.com/scidsg/project-info/blob/main/hush-line/5.%20Research/2.%20Legal/apple-v-andrew-aude.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take, for example, the case of Apple v. Andrew Aude</a>. He was using Signal on a work-issued phone. Even if he was using Tor in combination, if your employer can just take screenshots of your device, no amount of encryption or technology will keep you private.</p>
			            	<p>The lesson: never use your work-issued devices for anything you want to remain private or an employer-owned network to connect to a site you want to keep  private.</p>
			            	<p>A reasonable way to ensure anonymity is to use a Tor-only amnesiac operating system like Tails or a Whonix disposable VM on Qubes on an uncompromised device and network that you do not own or are related to, preferably using an updated device on a network that already has a lot of traffic.</p>
			            	<p>Keep in mind that this level of anonymity isn't necessary for all scenarios where you might want to send an anonymous tip. Always consider: What are you protecting, and who are you protecting it from? A message to the local newspaper about the noisy neighborhood construction? Or national security secrets from an authoritarian government?</p>
			            </div>
			        </li>
			        <li>
			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> Why not just use Signal?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>Signal is great. But for someone to send you a message, they must first:</p>
    							<ol>
									<li>Sign in to an app store</li>
									<li>Download Signal</li>
									<li>Register their phone number (yes, you still have to do this, even with usernames.)</li>
									<li>Find your username or phone number.</li>
									<li>Contact you.</li>
								</ol>
							<p>Signal is a perfect tool for talking to someone you know or with whom you have a baseline level of trust. It is linked to your phone, and you need a device with a phone number to use it.</p>
							<p>In contrast, Hush Line works with what's already on your phone or computer. All you need is a web browser to send a message anonymously. The end-user submitting a message needs no technical proficiency or prior knowledge to use the app immediately.</p>

							<p>Hush Line aims to be the first step for whistleblowers. When they don't know what to do first or next, a safe and effortless way to contact the right person should be the least of their worries. Once a baseline level of trust is established, other tools like Signal are more appropriate.</p>
			            </div>
			        </li>
			        <li>
			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> How is Hush Line different from SecureDrop?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>SecureDrop is a robust whistleblowing platform whose architecture is necessitated by very specific use cases: A.) To safely manage files sent by anonymous people so that a device or network isn't accidentally compromised, and  B.) To provide a censorship-resistant and anonymous method of sending and receiving those files. When someone submits a message, an account is created for them, allowing two-way communication. To use SecureDrop:</p>
							<p>The tip line owner must:</p>
    						<ol>
								<li>Do A LOT. SecureDrop is an "on-prem" solution, requiring you to store multiple servers locally, all focused on isolated tasks, using a dedicated network. Think of SecureDrop as a fixed workflow for receiving files. You must do all of the things correctly to assume safe operation. It requires a lot of time, which means a lot of money. The installation and setup of the system, in most cases, needs to be conducted by a member of the SD team, with service contracts helping to ensure proper maintenance of the infrastructure.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The message submitter must:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Learn how to use SecureDrop.</li>
								<li>Download Tor Browser.</li>
								<li>Find the correct Onion address for their recipient.</li>
								<li>Submit a message.</li>
								<li>Save their account credentials.</li>
								<li>Check back for progress.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Hush Line is not a replacement for SecureDrop. Instead, it's for organizations who might not need nation-state levels of defense for all of their anonymous tips. We simplify our threat model by being a text-only service, meaning there is no possibility of receiving files that could harm your computer or network.</p>
							<p>We're a managed service, so you don't have to worry about maintaining physical infrastructure or learning new workflows. In fact, to use our product, you don't have to log back into the service after setting it up. We deliver messages directly to your email inbox, so you can set it, forget it, and never miss a beat. Users can add their own public PGP key, giving them end-to-end encryption and ensuring messages cannot be read by anyone but the receiver.</p>
							<p>Hush Line is also available on a clearnet address, or through our onion service. Using the browser already on your computer or phone, you can easily submit a message without ever downloading a new app. Users who need higher levels of anonymity may optionally use our onion service, requiring them to download Tor Browser. This flexibility allows for our service to be used for benign use cases or elevated threat levels.</p>

			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> Why not fork SecureDrop's code?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>While open-source, forking SecureDrop would require significant rework and lock us into chasing dependencies as the SD project evolves. Building a new solution allows optimizing Hush Line as an easy-to-use hosted service.</p>

			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> Why Python?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>We use Python and the Flask framework because they're well-documented and supported. The developer ecosystem is rich with extensions for everything from user authentication to message encryption. Python is also one of the most used languages, making the project accessible to a greater number of engineers.</p>

			        <li>
			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> Why can't I receive files?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>Receiving files comes with risk, and the functionality is only sometimes necessary. Moreover, we challenge the need to immediately receive files by asking the question: Should you be receiving files anonymously without any baseline level of trust? If so, there are tools for that, but we don't recommend starting with them.</p>
			            </div>

			            <h4><a href="#" class="faq-question"><img class="arrow" src="design-system/images/website/icon-chevron.png"> How do I verify a recipient is legitimate?</a></h4>
			            <div class="faq-answer">
			            	<p>Hush Line offers human-verified accounts for journalists, organizations, and public figures so you can ensure you're communicating with the right recipient.</p>
